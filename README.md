## üöÄ Update and Upgrades

### Major version update

```bash
doas pkg update -f && doas pkg upgrade
doas pkg install tcbsd-upgrade
doas tcbsd-upgrade major
shutdown -r now
```

#### Post-upgrade Cleanup (Recommended)
This is a recommended step once the upgrade has completed, and you have verified that they system is working. 

```bash
# First, delete the old restore point to free up space.
# You will be prompted to select a restore point interactively.
# IMPORTANT: Select the one named exactly like: upgrade-backup-<your timestamp>
doas restorepoint destroy

# Now we clean up the old boot environment.
# This is usually called "default", and must be removed before renaming.
doas bectl destroy default

# Check your available boot environments to find the new one.
# Look for something like "upgrade-2025-07-24T09:22:50Z"
bectl list

# Rename the upgraded boot environment to "default"
# This is important ‚Äî many system tools expect a boot environment named "default"
# If you skip this step, future upgrades or restore operations will fail
doas bectl rename upgrade-<timestamp> default

# You can now reboot into a clean system state.
shutdown -r now
```

#### Jumping multiple major versions

To upgrade across multiple major versions (e.g. 12 ‚Üí 13 ‚Üí 14), you must repeat the entire upgrade process for each version step:

1. Perform the major upgrade (tcbsd-upgrade major).
2. Reboot into the new boot environment.
3. Verify system functionality.
4. Follow the post-upgrade cleanup steps.
